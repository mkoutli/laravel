# Create a pod containing the PHP-FPM application (my-php-app)
# and nginx, each mounting the `shared-files` volume to their

    # Create the shared files volume to be used in both pods
    - name: shared-files

          mountPath: /var/www
      # Important! After this container has started, the PHP files
      # in our Docker image aren't in the shared volume. We need to 
      # get them into the shared volume. If we tried to write directly
      # to this volume from our Docker image the files wouldn't appear
      # in the nginx container.
      #
      # So, after the container has started, copy the PHP files from this
      # container's local filesystem (/app -- added via the Docker image) 
      # to the shared volume, which is mounted at /var/www/html.
